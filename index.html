            Hello! My name is Benjamin Palmer but I go by Ben. I am 23 years old
            and I am a current student and BYU-I. A long time ago in the year 2000
            I was born in placerville California just outside of Sacramento. When I 
            was 2 and a half years old my family moved back to Salt Lake City where 
            I grew up. I am the youngest of 3 siblings and I enjoy meeting new people
            and playing board games with them. I also like to program. That's just a 
            little bit about me :)

        <p>
            Utah is full of many moutains and rock formations. These rock formations can be 
            found all over Utah. Salt Lake city, utah's captial, is found in the northan part of 
            utah. Many moutains surround utah creating a bowl like valley. This helps keep out torrnados 
            but also can trap much smog and pollution in the city.
