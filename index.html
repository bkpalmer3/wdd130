        <p>Hello! My name is Benjamin Palmer but I go by Ben. I am 23 years old
            and I am a current student and BYU-I. A long time ago in the year 2000
            I was born in placerville California just outside of Sacramento. When I 
            was 2 and a half years old my family moved back to Salt Lake City where 
            I grew up. I am the youngest of 3 siblings and I enjoy meeting new people
            and playing board games with them. I also like to program. That's just a 
            little bit about me :)
