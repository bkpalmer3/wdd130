            Hello! My name is Benjamin Palmer but I go by Ben. I am 23 years old
            and I am a current student and BYU-I. A long time ago in the year 2000
            I was born in placerville California just outside of Sacramento. When I 
            was 2 and a half years old my family moved back to Salt Lake City where 
            I grew up. I am the youngest of 3 siblings and I enjoy meeting new people
            and playing board games with them. I also like to program.  I haven't done much
            programing before college but when I got here I took a programming class and loved
            it. I have always wanted to travel, growing up my family never really left their home
            and so I have always wanted to explore new places like italy and new york. I can play 
            the ukelele and harmonica and I am working on learning the bongos. I am very excited to be 
            in this class. That's just a little bit about me :)

       <h2>Utah</h2>

        <p>
            Utah is full of many moutains and rock formations. These rock formations can be 
            found all over Utah. Salt Lake city, utah's captial, is found in the northan part of 
            utah. Many moutains surround utah creating a bowl like valley. This helps keep out torrnados 
            but also can trap much smog and pollution in the city.
